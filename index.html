<h1>Privacy Community Group</h1>
</header>

<p>Hi. We’re the <a href=/>Privacy Community Group</a> of the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/><abbr
title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr></a>.

<p>The Privacy
<a href=https://www.w3.org/community/><abbr
title="Community Group">CG</abbr></a>
is <a href=charter.html>chartered</a> <q cite=charter.html#mission>to
incubate privacy-focused web features and APIs to improve user privacy
on the web through enhanced browser behavior.</q> If that sounds
interesting to you, please
<a href=https://www.w3.org/community/privacycg/join>join us</a>!
(In order to join, you'll need to
<a href=https://www.w3.org/accounts/request>request a W3C account</a>
if you don't already have one.)

<p>If you have any questions or concerns, the
<a href=charter.html#chairs>chairs</a> are more than happy to help. The
easiest way to get in touch with them is to
<a href=https://github.com/privacycg/admin/issues/new>file an issue</a>
(preferred) or to
simply <a href=mailto:erik.anderson@microsoft.com;hober@apple.com;tanvi@mozilla.com>email
them</a> (if your concern can’t be raised publicly).

<h2>Our Work</h2>

<p>We conduct all of our technical work in public, mainly in
<a href=https://github.com/privacycg/>various GitHub repositories</a>
but also in periodic teleconferences and face-to-face meetings.

<ul>
<li>We try to keep the <a href=charter.html#work-items>list of our
current work items</a> in our <a href=charter.html>charter</a>
up-to-date. You can follow links from there to each work item’s GitHub
repository, where you can see the latest text, and file or comment on
issues.
<li>We discuss new proposals in our
<a href=https://github.com/privacycg/proposals>proposals repository</a>.
<li>We have teleconferences twice a month, and occasional face-to-face
meetings throughout the year. We organize our meetings and publish the
agendas and minutes from them in our
<a href=https://github.com/privacycg/meetings/>meetings repository</a>.
</ul>

<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>Please note that all work and communication within the Privacy CG is
covered by the <a href=https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/>W3C Code of
Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.
