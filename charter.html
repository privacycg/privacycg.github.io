<h1>Privacy Community Group Charter</h1>
</header>

<h2 id=mission>Mission</h2>

<p>The mission of the <a href=https://privacycg.github.io/>Privacy
Community Group</a>, motivated by the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/ethical-web-principles/>W3C TAG
Ethical Web Principles</a>, is to incubate privacy-focused web features
and APIs to improve user privacy on the web through enhanced browser
behavior.

<p>The group welcomes participation from browser vendors, privacy
advocates, web application developers, and other interested parties.

<h2 id=scope>Scope</h2>

<p>The Community Group will discuss ideas for new privacy-focused web
platform features intended to be implemented in browsers or similar user
agents. The group will also discuss potential modifications of existing
web platform features aimed at improving user privacy on the web.

<h3 id=out-of-scope>Out of Scope</h3>

<p>Features or ideas that don’t pertain to privacy and have
applicability in a browser (or similar user agent) should be proposed
elsewhere.

<p class=note>This group does not perform
<a href=https://www.w3.org/Guide/process/charter.html#horizontal-review>horizontal
review</a> for privacy at <a href=https://www.w3.org/><abbr
title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr></a>; that is the
responsibility of the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/Privacy/IG/>Privacy Interest Group
(PING)</a>.

<h2 id=chairs>Chairs</h2>

<p>The <dfn>Chairs</dfn> of the Privacy Community Group are:

<ul>
<li>Erik Anderson &lt;<a href=mailto:erik.anderson@microsoft.com>erik.anderson@microsoft.com</a>&gt; (<a href=https://www.microsoft.com/>Microsoft</a>)
<li>Theresa O’Connor &lt;<a href=mailto:hober@apple.com>hober@apple.com</a>&gt; (<a href=https://www.apple.com/>Apple</a>)
<li>Martin Thomson &lt;<a href=mailto:mt@mozilla.com>mt@mozilla.com</a>&gt; (<a href=https://www.mozilla.org/>Mozilla</a>)
</ul>

<p>The Chairs are responsible for the day-to-day running of the group,
including:

<ul>
<li>encouraging participation in the group,
<li>managing the group's GitHub organization and repositories, website,
  and online presence,
<li>ensuring the group adheres to its <a href=#process>Process</a>,
<li>judging features or ideas as in or <a href=#out-of-scope>out</a>
of <a href=#scope>scope</a>,
<li>focusing the group's limited time on the Proposals and Work Items
most likely to positively impact privacy on the web via wide
implementation and adoption,
<li>moderating the group's discussions, whatever the forum (GitHub,
mailing lists, face to face, etc.),
<li>running teleconferences and
face-to-face <a href=#meetings>meetings</a>,
<li>ensuring contributions to Proposals are only made by Community Group
Participants who have agreed to the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/>W3C Community
Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>,
<li>and keeping this Charter compliant with the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/>Community and
Business Group Process</a>, updating it as necessary.
</ul>

<p>The Chairs have a number of other powers and responsibilities which
are defined throughout this document.

<p>No two Chairs can be from the same organization.

<p>Except where otherwise specified, all decisions made by the Chairs
are expected to be made <a href=#consensus>by consensus</a>. If
consensus cannot be found among the Chairs, and unanimity is not
otherwise required, the Chairs may make decisions by supermajority (at
least 2/3rds support).

<h3 id=notices>Announcements</h3>

<p>When the Chairs are required to <dfn>notify the group</dfn> of
something, they will raise an issue in the
<a href=https://github.com/privacycg/admin><code>privacycg/admin</code></a>
repository labeled
<a href=https://github.com/privacycg/admin/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aannouncement><code>announcement</code></a>,
and will ensure the topic is covered at the
next <a href=#meetings>meeting</a>.

<h3 id=chair-selection>Chair Selection</h3>

<p>Within the above constraints, additional Chairs may be appointed by
unanimous consent of the then-current Chairs.

<p>If the number of Chairs becomes zero, or if five Community Group
Participants—no two from the same organization—call for an election, the
group must use the following process to elect a new Chair, consulting
the Community Development Lead on election operations (e.g., voting
infrastructure and using <a href=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2777>RFC
2777</a>):

<ol>
<li>Participants announce their candidacies. Participants have 14 days
to announce their candidacies. No two candidates can be from the same
organization. If there is only one candidate, that person becomes the
Chair. If there are two or more candidates, there is a vote. (In the
unlikely event that there are no candidates and the number of current
Chairs is zero, Community Group Participants should ask the Community
Development Lead for guidance on how to proceed.)
<li>Participants vote. Multiple Participants from the same organization
collectively share one vote. Participants have 21 days to vote for a
single candidate. In case of a tie,
<a href=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2777>RFC 2777</a> is used to
break the tie.
</ol>

<p>Participants dissatisfied with the outcome of an election may ask the
Community Development Lead to intervene. The Community Development Lead,
after evaluating the election, may take any action including no action.

<p class=note>The Community Development Lead is a member of W3C staff
chosen by W3C leadership to manage the Community Groups program. As of
the drafting of this charter, the Community Development Lead was
<a href=https://www.w3.org/People/functions/w3m#dom>Dominique
Hazaël-Massieux</a>.

<h2 id=proposals>Proposals</h2>

<p>A <dfn>Proposal</dfn> is an idea brought to the Community Group for
consideration and potential adoption as a <a href=#work-items>Work
Item</a>.

<p>Each Proposal has one or more <dfn>Champions</dfn>, beginning with
the Community Group Participant who proposed it. Champions are
self-organized. Proposals should explicitly list their Champions, and
Champions should keep this list updated as the set of Champions for the
Proposal changes.

<p>Any Community Group Participant may make a Proposal by filing
<a href=https://github.com/privacycg/proposals/issues>an issue</a> in
the
<a href=https://github.com/privacycg/proposals><code>privacycg/proposals</code></a>
repository on GitHub, stating the problem they would like to address and
how they propose to address it.

<p>The Community Group may discuss the Proposal on GitHub and during
teleconferences or face-to-face <a href=#meetings>meetings</a>.

<p>Champions are responsible for the technical content of their
Proposal. They are expected to solicit input from Community Group
Participants, and they may consider and respond to comments,
suggestions, and objections on their Proposal from Participants and the
public.

<p>Champions may ask the <a href=#chairs>Chairs</a> to create a
dedicated repository for their Proposal. The Chairs will generally honor
such requests, though they may choose not to (if, for example, they
believe the Proposal to be <a href=#out-of-scope>out of scope</a>).

<p>Proposals begin as or evolve into
<a href=https://w3ctag.github.io/explainers>explainers</a> which
describe a user-facing problem which needs to be solved and how the
authors propose to solve it. Explainers are Community Group Reports as
defined in the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/>Community and
Business Group Process</a>, but they are not Specifications as defined
in that document.

<p>Proposals may be withdrawn by their Champions, or may be closed by
the Chairs (if, for example, the Chairs deem the Proposal to
be <a href=out-of-scope>out of scope</a>, or if its number of Champions
drops to zero). If such a Proposal has a dedicated repository, the
Chairs and Champions should take steps to ensure the data is not lost,
perhaps by archiving the repository or by transferring it to a different
organization or user.

<h2 id=work-items>Work Items</h2>

This Community Group may produce <dfn>Work Items</dfn>—a special kind of
Community Group Report whose purpose is to work toward interoperability
between independent implementations of the features it defines. Work
Items are Specifications as defined in the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/>Community and
Business Group Process</a>. Each Work Item has one or
more <a href=#editors>Editors</a>, who are appointed by
the <a href=#chairs>Chairs</a>.

<p>The current set of Work Items of the Community Group are:

<table>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This list will be kept <a href=#amendments>updated</a> by the Chairs
to reflect the current set of Work Items of the Community Group.

<p>The Community Group may adopt a <a href="#proposals">Proposal</a> as
a Work Item if it is the <a href=#consensus>consensus</a> of its
Champions and the Chairs that such a Work Item would be likely to enable
and lead to independent, interoperable implementations. The Chairs and
Champions may solicit commitments from organizations to provide
<a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/Process-20190301/#implementation-experience">adequate
implementation experience</a> of the Proposal's features, and may take
such commitments or other such expressions of implementer interest into
account when making their decision.

<p>Each Work Item should be accompanied by an explainer describing its
proposed changes to the web platform. Editors should keep the Work
Item's explainer up-to-date with the Work Item as it evolves.

<p class=note>Because Work Items begin life as Proposals, they typically
start out with an explainer already written, and Proposal Champions are
typically appointed Editors.

<p>When a Work Item's Editors deem the Work Item ready for migration,
they will notify the Chairs. The CG may produce a Final Community Group
Report at this time. The Editors and Chairs will identify the best
destination standards body or bodies, and will then work with those
bodies to successfully migrate the Work Item.

<p class=note>When migrated to the standards track, Work Items might
become standalone specifications, they might be integrated into one or
more existing specifications, or they might result in a combination of
these options.

<p>The Chairs may remove Work Items. The Chairs
must <a href=#notices>notify the group</a> of the removal of Work Items,
and this notice must include rationale. Some possible reasons for
removing a Work Item are:

<ul>
<li>because the Work Item has been migrated elsewhere
<li>because it is no longer the <a href=#consensus>consensus</a> of its
Champions and the Chairs that the Work Item is likely to enable and lead
to independent, interoperable implementations.
<li>because the Work Item no longer has an <a href=#editors>Editor</a>
and a replacement cannot be found
</ul>

<p>The Chairs should take steps to ensure the repositories of removed
Work Items are not lost, perhaps by archiving the repository or by
transferring it to a different organization or user.

<h2 id=coordination>Coordination</h2>

<p>This group will collaborate with appropriate groups at
<a href=https://www.w3.org/><abbr
title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr></a>,
<a href=https://whatwg.org/><abbr
title="Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group">WHATWG</abbr></a>,
<a href=https://www.ecma-international.org/>Ecma</a>,
<a href=https://ietf.org/><abbr
title="Internet Engineering Task Force">IETF</abbr></a>, and elsewhere,
and will migrate <a href=#work-items>Work Items</a> to them when they’re
ready for the standards track. Groups most likely to be close partners
are listed below, but this group is expected to coordinate with other
groups as relevant.

<h3 id=w3c-coordination>W3C Groups</h3>

<dl>
<dt><a href=https://www.w3.org/Privacy/IG/>Privacy Interest Group
(PING)</a>
<dd>This group will coordinate with PING and will take into
consideration outputs of PING when
evaluating <a href=#proposals>Proposals</a> and <a href=#work-items>Work
Items</a>.

<dt><a href=https://www.w3.org/2011/webappsec/>Web Application Security
Working Group (WebAppSec)</a>
<dd>WebAppSec is expected to be a destination for transitioning Work
Items to the standards track.

<dt><a href=https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/>Web Platform Incubator
Community Group (WICG)</a>
<dd>WICG is expected to be a major source of Proposals for this group.
</dl>

<h3 id=external-coordination>External Organizations</h3>

<dl>
<dt><a href=https://whatwg.org/>Web Hypertext Application Technology
Working Group (WHATWG)</a>
<dd>Many of our Work Items will likely result in pull requests on
various WHATWG specs.
</dl>

<h2 id=process>Process</h2>

<p>The group operates under the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/>Community and
Business Group Process</a>. This Charter is the sole operational
agreement of the Community Group. Terms in this Charter that conflict
with those of the Community and Business Group Process, the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/>Community
Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>, or the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/final/>Final
Specification Agreement</a> are void.

<p>All work and communication within this group is covered by the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/>W3C Code of Ethics and
Professional Conduct</a>.

<p>Contributions to <a href=#proposals>Proposals</a>
and <a href=#work-items>Work Items</a> can only be made by Community
Group Participants who have agreed to the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/>W3C Community
Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>.

<p class=note>This group’s <a href=#process>process</a>,
asynchronous <a href=#work-mode>work mode</a>, and
efficient <a href=#decisions>decision policy</a> are based on those of
the WHATWG. These policies have been adapted to fit both the
requirements of the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/>Community and
Business Group Process</a> and the particular needs of a group focused
on privacy.

<h3 id=editors>Editors</h3>

<p><dfn>Editors</dfn> are responsible for the technical content of
their <a href=#work-items>Work Item</a> and have sole authority to
modify the Work Item (though their decisions may be overridden by the
<a href=#chairs>Chairs</a>; see <a href=#decisions>below</a>).

<p>Editors are responsible for
<ul>
<li>ensuring any applied changes fulfill the relevant criteria for
changes.
<li>resolving conflicts between contributors.
<li>reducing open issues.
<li>helping to manage the corresponding tests.
<li>ensuring (together with implementers) implementations follow the
requirements and vice versa. (The “don’t write fiction” rule.)
<li>ensuring contributions to their Work Item are only made by
Community Group Participants who have agreed to the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/>W3C Community
Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>, and
<li>ensuring that there are no unresolved substantive objections from
Community Group Participants before merging contributions or otherwise
modifying their Work Item.
</ul>

<p>Changes of an editorial nature can be made, accepted, or rejected by
editors without discussion.

<p>Editors may solicit input from Community Group Participants, and may
consider and respond to comments, suggestions, and objections from
Participants and the public.

<p>Editors may commit changes to their Work Items without further
review, provided they adhere to the requirements in this document.

<h3 id=work-mode>Work Mode</h3>

<p>The group generally conducts its technical work in public.

<p>Community Group participants agree to make all contributions in the
GitHub repository the group is using for the particular document. This
might be in the form of a pull request, by raising an issue, or by
adding a comment to an existing issue or pull request.

<p>This group practices responsible disclosure of security and privacy
vulnerabilities in our work. The Chairs will ensure that instructions
for reporting security or privacy issues are
<a href=https://github.com/privacycg/.github/blob/master/SECURITY.md>posted
on GitHub</a> and kept up-to-date.

<h4 id=meetings>Meetings</h4>

<p>The Community Group may hold teleconferences and face-to-face
meetings. The <a href=#chairs>Chairs</a> will determine the schedule,
logistics, and agenda of each, in consultation
with <a href=#editors>Editors</a> and Community Group Participants.
Minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be
<a href=https://github.com/privacycg/meetings>archived</a> for public
review.

<p class=note>Conclusions reached in meetings are tentative; see
the <a href=#decisions>Decision Policy</a>.

<h3 id=decisions>Decision Policy</h3>

<p><a href=#editors>Editors</a> must respond to substantive issues
raised on their <a href=#work-items>Work Item</a> by Community Group
Participants. Editors have discretion to resolve issues based on
available information.

<p>To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any
conclusions reached in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference are
tentative, and will be recorded in the relevant issues, pull requests,
or repositories for consideration by Community Group Participants. Any
Community Group Participant may object to a decision reached at a
face-to-face meeting or teleconference within 14 days of publication of
the decision provided that they include clear technical reasons for
their objection. The <a href=#chairs>Chairs</a> and Editors will
facilitate discussion to try to resolve the objection.

<p>In case of a conflict among Community Group Participants, Editors are
expected to go to significant lengths to resolve disagreements. In the
end, they make a judgment call to pick the best option they believe will
preserve privacy and lead to independent, interoperable implementations.

<p>If a Community Group Participant is not satisfied with the resolution
of an issue, they may request that the Editors revisit the issue. If not
satisfied with the Editors’ final response, Community Group Participants
may <a href=#appeals>appeal to the Chairs</a>. The Chairs may correct or
uphold the decision based on their own understanding of what will best
preserve privacy and lead to independent, interoperable implementations.

<p>It is the Chairs’ responsibility to ensure that the decision process
is fair and does not unreasonably favor or discriminate against any
Community Group Participant or organization.

<p>The Chairs may override Editors’ decisions, or remove Editors.

<p>Implementations can always override the editors by implementing
something else. Whenever that happens a breakdown in communication has
taken place that the Community Group should seek to overcome and find
ways to prevent it from happening again.

<p>When implementations disagree, the Editors will try to find a
solution that is privacy-preserving and mutually acceptable
to implementers. If no such solution is
identified, the Editors will research expectations of existing web
content and specify the most privacy-preserving, web-compatible
approach. If there isn’t enough existing web content affected by the
change to make compatibility a concern, the Editors will, to the extent
possible, be consistent with our goal to increase user privacy and align
with implementer majority.

<p>Work Items should not make references to or rely on specific browser
engine implementation details.

<h4 id=appeals>Appeals</h4>

<p>Community Group Participants may raise substantive issues for
resolution by the <a href=#chairs>Chairs</a>.

<p>To raise an issue on a <a href=#work-items>Work Item</a> for review
by the <a href=#editors>Editors</a> and other Community Group
Participants, a Community Group Participant must:

<ol>
<li>Identify the issue clearly (technical problem, interoperability
issue, inconsistency with the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/ethical-web-principles/>W3C
TAG Ethical Web Principles</a>, etc.) and recommend a solution;
<li>Post the issue for review in the Work Item’s repository; and
<li>Endeavor to resolve the issue with the Editors or in concert with
other Community Group Participants.
</ol>

<p>If the Community Group Participant finds those efforts
unsatisfactory, they may:

<ol>
<li>Summarize the issue and the efforts to resolve it, and forward the
summary and any supporting details to the Chairs, with a copy to the
Community Group.
<li>The Chairs may then invite the Editors and other Community Group
Participants to comment, may request additional materials, schedule a
meeting, or take other actions for its review.
</ol>

<p>The Chairs then make their determination at their sole discretion.

<h2 id=patentpolicy>Patent Policy</h2>

<p>As with other Community Groups, W3C seeks organizational licensing
commitments under the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/> W3C
Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>. When people request
to participate without representing their organization’s legal
interests, W3C will in general approve those requests for this group
with the following understanding: W3C will seek and expect an
organizational commitment under the CLA starting with the individual’s
first request to make a contribution to a
group <a href=#work-items>Work Item</a>.

<h2 id=licensing>Licensing</h2>

<p>Work Items of this Community Group will use the
<a href=http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-and-document>W3C
Software and Document License</a>, unless
the <a href=#editors>Editors</a> expect the <a href=#work-items>Work
Item</a> to transition to a standards body which uses a different
license. In such cases, the Editors may use the license of the target
standards body.

<p class=example title="Example: HTML Pull Request">A Work Item
expected to end up as a pull request on the
<a href=https://html.spec.whatwg.org>HTML Living Standard</a> could be
licensed under the
<a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International License</a>.

<h2 id=amendments>Amendments to this Charter</h2>

<p>This Charter may be amended at any time by unanimous consent of the
<a href=#chairs>Chairs</a>. The Chairs will periodically update this
Charter to reflect the addition and removal of <a href=#work-items>Work
Items</a>, <a href=#editors>Editors</a>, and Chairs.

<p class=note>Per the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/>Community and
Business Group Process</a>, the Chairs must <a href=#notices>notify the
group</a> of any material changes to the Charter.

<h2 id=glossary>Glossary</h2>

<dl>
  <dt id=consensus>consensus
  <dd>
    <p>This Community Group uses the WHATWG
    <a href=https://whatwg.org/sg-agreement#consensus>definition of
    consensus</a>: “the parties concur. Consensus may be established
    tacitly. By way of example, so long as (1) proposed actions are
    clear and visible, (2) participants have opportunities to voice
    concerns, and (3) there is no sustained, substantive opposition,
    then Consensus may be established simply by moving forward on the
    proposal or a course of action; this is anticipated to be the norm
    for most matters.”
