<h1>Privacy Community Group Charter</h1>
</header>

<h2 id=mission>Mission</h2>

<p>The mission of the <a href=https://privacycg.github.io/>Privacy
Community Group</a> is to develop privacy-focused web standards and APIs
to improve user privacy on the web through enhanced browser behavior.

<p>The group welcomes participation from browser vendors, privacy
advocates, web application developers, and other interested parties.

<h2 id=scope>Scope</h2>

<p>The Community Group will discuss proposals for new privacy-focused
web platform features intended to be implemented in browsers or similar
user agents. The group will also discuss potential modifications of
existing web platform features aimed at improving user privacy on the
web.

<h3 id=out-of-scope>Out of Scope</h3>

<p>Features or ideas that don’t pertain to privacy and have
applicability in a browser (or similar user agent) should be proposed
elsewhere.

<p class=note>This group does not perform
<a href=https://www.w3.org/Guide/process/charter.html#horizontal-review>horizontal
review</a> for privacy at <a href=https://www.w3.org/><abbr
title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr></a>; that is the
responsibility of the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/Privacy/IG/>Privacy Interest Group
(PING)</a>.

<h2 id=chairs>Chairs</h2>

<p>The Chairs of the Privacy Community Group are:

<ul>
<li>Erik Anderson &lt;<a href=mailto:erik.anderson@microsoft.com>erik.anderson@microsoft.com</a>&gt; (<a href=https://www.microsoft.com/>Microsoft</a>)
<li>Theresa O’Connor &lt;<a href=mailto:hober@apple.com>hober@apple.com</a>&gt; (<a href=https://www.apple.com/>Apple</a>)
<li>Tanvi Vyas &lt;<a href=mailto:tanvi@mozilla.com>tanvi@mozilla.com</a>&gt; (<a href=https://www.mozilla.org/>Mozilla</a>)
</ul>

<p>There can be at most three Chairs.

<p>No two Chairs can be from the same organization.

<p>Except where otherwise specified, all decisions made by the Chairs
are expected to be made <a href=#consensus>by consensus</a>. If
consensus cannot be found among the Chairs, and unanimity is not
otherwise required, the Chairs may make decisions by supermajority (at
least 2/3rds support).

<h3 id=chair-selection>Chair Selection</h3>

<p>Within the above constraints, additional Chairs may be appointed by
unanimous consent of the then-current Chairs.

<p>If the number of Chairs becomes zero, or if five Community Group
Participants—no two from the same organization—call for an election, the
group must use the following process to elect a new Chair, consulting
the Community Development Lead on election operations (e.g., voting
infrastructure and using <a href=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2777>RFC
2777</a>):

<ol>
<li>Participants announce their candidacies. Participants have 14 days
to announce their candidacies. No two candidates can be from the same
organization. If there is only one candidate, that person becomes the
Chair. If there are two or more candidates, there is a vote. (In the
unlikely event that there are no candidates and the number of current
Chairs is zero, Community Group Participants should ask the Community
Development Lead for guidance on how to proceed.)
<li>Participants vote. Multiple Participants from the same organization
collectively share one vote. Participants have 21 days to vote for a
single candidate. In case of a tie,
<a href=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2777>RFC 2777</a> is used to
break the tie.
</ol>

<p>Participants dissatisfied with the outcome of an election may ask the
Community Development Lead to intervene. The Community Development Lead,
after evaluating the election, may take any action including no action.

<p class=note>The Community Development Lead is a member of W3C staff
chosen by W3C leadership to manage the Community Groups program. As of
the drafting of this charter, the Community Development Lead was
<a href=https://www.w3.org/People/functions/w3m#dom>Dominique
Hazaël-Massieux</a>.

<h2 id=deliverables>Deliverables</h2>

<p>The <a href=#chairs>Chairs</a> may add Deliverables, but must not add
Deliverables which lack the support of at least
two <a href=#implementer>implementers</a>.

<p>The Chairs may remove Deliverables.

<p>This document will be updated to reflect the current set of
Deliverables of the Community Group.

<!--When we start adding Deliverables, we’ll remove this paragraph and
the followng list, and replace them with the commented-out bits below.-->
<p>There are no Deliverables of this Community Group at the present
time. Potential future Deliverables include, but are not limited to, the
following WICG work items:

<ul>
<li><a href=https://github.com/WICG/ad-click-attribution>Private Click Measurement</a>
<li><a href=https://github.com/WICG/trust-token-api>Trust Token API</a>

and will transition spec proposals to them when they’re ready for the
standards track. Groups most likely to be close partners are listed
below, but this group is expected to coordinate with other groups as
relevant.

<h3 id=w3c-coordination>W3C Groups</h3>

<dl>
<dt><a href=https://www.w3.org/Privacy/IG/>Privacy Interest Group (PING)</a>
<dd>This group will coordinate with PING and will take into
consideration outputs of PING when evaluating proposals.
<dt><a href=https://www.w3.org/2011/webappsec/>Web Application Security
Working Group (WebAppSec)</a>
<dd>WebAppSec is expected to be the main destination for transitioning
this group’s independent Deliverables to the standards track.
<dt><a href=https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/>Web Platform Incubator
Community Group (WICG)</a>
<dd>WICG is expected to be a major source of Deliverables for this
group.
<p class=note>Only privacy-related WICG work items which have the
support of at least two <a href=#implementer>implementers</a> are
eligible for this group to take up as Deliverables.

<h3 id=external-coordination>External Organizations</h3>

<dl>
<dt><a href=https://whatwg.org/>Web Hypertext Application Technology
Working Group (WHATWG)</a>
<dd>Much of this group’s work will likely result in pull requests on
various WHATWG specs.
</dl>

<h2 id=process>Process</h2>

<p>The group operates under the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/>Community and
Business Group Process</a>. This Charter is the sole operational
agreement of the Community Group. Terms in this Charter that conflict
with those of the Community and Business Group Process, the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/>Community
Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>, or the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/final/>Final
Specification Agreement</a> are void.

<p>All work and communication within this group is covered by the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/>W3C Code of Ethics and
Professional Conduct</a>.

<p>Contributions to Deliverables can only be made by Community Group
Participants who have agreed to the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/>W3C Community
Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>.

<p class=note>This group’s <a href=#process>process</a>,
asynchronous <a href=#work-mode>work mode</a>, and
efficient <a href=#decisions>decision policy</a> are based on those of
the WHATWG. These policies have been adapted to fit both the
requirements of the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/>Community and
Business Group Process</a> and the particular needs of a group focused
on privacy.

<h3 id=editors>Editors</h3>

<p>The Chairs appoint one or more Editors per Deliverable. Editors are
responsible for the technical content of the Deliverable and have sole
authority to modify the Deliverable (though their decisions may be
overridden by the Chairs; see <a href=#decisions>below</a>).

<p>Editors are responsible for
<ul>
<li>ensuring any applied changes fulfill the relevant criteria for
changes.
<li>resolving conflicts between contributors.
<li>reducing open issues.
<li>helping to manage the corresponding tests.
<li>ensuring (together with implementers) implementations follow the
standard and vice versa. (The “don’t write fiction” rule.)
<li>ensuring contributions to their Deliverable are only made by
Community Group Participants who have agreed to the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/>W3C Community
Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>, and
<li>ensuring that there are no unresolved substantive objections from
Community Group Participants before merging contributions or otherwise
modifying their Deliverable.
</ul>

<p>Changes of an editorial nature can be made, accepted, or rejected by
editors without discussion.

<p>Editors may solicit input from Community Group Participants, and may
consider and respond to comments, suggestions, and objections from
Participants and the public.

<p>Editors may commit changes to their Deliverables without further
review, provided they adhere to the requirements in this document.

<h3 id=work-mode>Work Mode</h3>

<p>The group will conduct all of its technical work in public. Community
Group participants agree to make all contributions in the GitHub
repository the group is using for the particular document. This might be
in the form of a pull request, by raising an issue, or by adding a
comment to an existing issue or pull request.

<p>Any change that represents a feature addition must have the support
of at least two <a href=#implementer>implementers</a>.

<p>For any change that removes a feature, the feature being removed must
either be not widely implemented, or must in the process of being
removed from implementations.

<h4 id=meetings>Meetings</h4>

<p>The Community Group may hold teleconferences and face-to-face
meetings. The Chairs will determine the schedule, logistics, and agenda
of each, in consultation with Editors and Community Group Participants.
Minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived
for public review.

<p class=note>Conclusions reached in meetings are tentative; see
the <a href=#decisions>Decision Policy</a>.

<h3 id=decisions>Decision Policy</h3>

<p>Editors must respond to substantive issues raised on their
Deliverable by Community Group Participants. Editors have discretion to
resolve issues based on available information.

<p>To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any
conclusions reached in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference are
tentative, and will be recorded in the relevant issues, pull requests,
or repositories for consideration by Community Group Participants. Any
Community Group Participant may object to a decision reached at a
face-to-face meeting or teleconference within 14 days of publication of
the decision provided that they include clear technical reasons for
their objection. The Chairs and Editors will facilitate discussion to
try to resolve the objection.

<p>In case of a conflict among Community Group Participants, Editors are
expected to go to significant lengths to resolve disagreements. In the
end, they make a judgment call to pick the best option they believe will
have <a href=#implementer>multi-implementer support</a>.

<p>If a Community Group Participant is not satisfied with the resolution
of an issue, they may request that the Editors revisit the issue. If not
satisfied with the Editors’ final response, Community Group Participants
may <a href=#appeals>appeal to the Chairs</a>.

<p>If a Community Group Participant believes the Editors’ choice will
not have <a href=#implementer>multi-implementer support</a>, and they
cannot convince the Editors, then they may <a href=#appeals>appeal to
the Chairs</a>. The Chairs may correct or uphold the decision based on
their own understanding of support
from <a href=#implementer>implementers</a>.

<p>It is the Chairs’ responsibility to ensure that the decision process
is fair and does not unreasonably favor or discriminate against any
Community Group Participant or organization.

<p>The Chairs may override Editors’ decisions, or remove Editors.

<p>Implementations can always override the editors by implementing
something else. Whenever that happens a breakdown in communication has
taken place that the Community Group should seek to overcome and find
ways to prevent it from happening again.

<p>When implementations disagree, the Editors will try to find a
solution that is privacy-preserving and mutually acceptable
to <a href=#implementer>implementers</a>. If no such solution is
identified, the Editors will research expectations of existing web
content and specify the most privacy-preserving, web-compatible
approach. If there isn’t enough existing web content affected by the
change to make compatibility a concern, the Editors will, to the extent
possible, be consistent with our goal to increase user privacy and align
with <a href=#implementer>implementer</a> majority.

<p>Implementation disagreement should not result in
implementation-defined behavior or optional features.

<p>Specifications should not make references to or rely on specific
browser engine implementation details.

<h4 id=appeals>Appeals</h4>

<p>Community Group Participants may raise substantive issues for
resolution by the Chairs.

<p>To raise an issue on a Deliverable for review by the Editors and
other Community Group Participants, a Community Group Participant must:

<ol>
<li>Identify the issue clearly (technical problem, interoperability
issue, inconsistency with the
<a href=https://w3ctag.github.io/ethical-web-principles/>W3C TAG Ethical
Web Principles</a>, etc.) and recommend a solution;
<li>Post the issue for review in the Deliverable’s repository; and
<li>Endeavor to resolve the issue with the Editors or in concert with
other Community Group Participants.
</ol>

<p>If the Community Group Participant finds those efforts
unsatisfactory, they may:

<ol>
<li>Summarize the issue and the efforts to resolve it, and forward the
summary and any supporting details to the Chairs, with a copy to the
Community Group.
<li>The Chairs may then invite the Editors and other Community Group
Participants to comment, may request additional materials, schedule a
meeting, or take other actions for its review.
</ol>

<p>The Chairs then make their determination at their sole discretion.

<h2 id=patentpolicy>Patent Policy</h2>

<p>As with other Community Groups, W3C seeks organizational licensing
commitments under the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/> W3C
Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>. When people request
to participate without representing their organization’s legal
interests, W3C will in general approve those requests for this group
with the following understanding: W3C will seek and expect an
organizational commitment under the CLA starting with the individual’s
first request to make a contribution to a
group <a href=#deliverables>Deliverable</a>.

<h2 id=licensing>Licensing</h2>

<p>Deliverables of this Community Group will use the
<a href=http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-and-document>W3C
Software and Document License</a>, unless the Editors expect the
Deliverable to transition to a standards body which uses a different
license. In such cases, the Editors may use the license of the target
standards body.

<p class=example title="Example: HTML Pull Request">A Deliverable
expected to end up as a pull request on the
<a href=https://html.spec.whatwg.org>HTML Living Standard</a> could be
licensed under the
<a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International License</a>.

<h2 id=amendments>Amendments to this Charter</h2>

<p>This Charter may be amended at any time by unanimous consent of the
Chairs. The Chairs will periodically update this Charter to reflect the
addition and removal of Deliverables, Editors, and Chairs.

<p class=note>Per the
<a href=https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/>Community and
Business Group Process</a>, the Chairs must notify Community Group
Participants of any material changes to the Charter.

<h2 id=glossary>Glossary</h2>

<dl>
  <dt id=consensus>consensus
  <dd>
    <p>This Community Group uses the WHATWG
    <a href=https://whatwg.org/sg-agreement#consensus>definition of
    consensus</a>: “the parties concur. Consensus may be established
    tacitly. By way of example, so long as (1) proposed actions are
    clear and visible, (2) participants have opportunities to voice
    concerns, and (3) there is no sustained, substantive opposition,
    then Consensus may be established simply by moving forward on the
    proposal or a course of action; this is anticipated to be the norm
    for most matters.”
  <dt id=implementer>implementer
  <dd>
    <p>The WHATWG
    <a href=https://whatwg.org/sg-agreement#qualifying-entity>defines
    implementer</a> as "an entity that develops one of the core
    end-to-end integrated web browser platform engines and distributes
    its integrated implementations widely." This definition is useful
    for determining multi-implementer support of core web platform
    features, features which are typically and reasonably implemented
    within the core end-to-end integrated web browser platform engines,
    and this Community Group relies on this definition for such
    features.
    <p>Some privacy-related features ship in browsers but are not
    implemented within browser engines. In cases where multiple entities
    share a browser engine in common, they only count as multiple
    implementers of a feature if that feature’s implementations are
    separate and are not believed to be specific to the internals of the
    engine.
    <p class=example title="Example: two browsers, separate engines">The
    Peach Foundation ships Walkabout, a web browser built on the
    MeshTools browser engine. Nanoware also ships a web browser, Vertex,
    built on the Shrug browser engine. If a feature has the support in
    both MeshTools and Shrug, as shipping (or as is expected to ship) in
    Walkabout and Vertex, it can be said to have multi-implementer
    support.
    <p class=example title="Example: two browsers, shared engine, shared
    implementation">Valiant Inc. ships Valiant, a web browser built on
    the Shrug browser engine. The Avogadro Corporation ships a web
    browser, Veneer, also built on the Shrug browser engine. A feature
    implemented in Shrug counts as having one implementer supporting it,
    even if that feature ships in both Valiant and Veneer.
    <p class=example title="Example: two browsers, shared engine,
    separate implementations (existing)">Valiant and Vertex both ship a
    feature, but it is not a feature with a shared, underlying
    implementation in the Shrug engine. Such a feature counts as having
    two implementers supporting it, even though Valiant and Vertex are
    both built on Shrug, because this particular feature has seperate,
    non-shared implementations.
    <p class=example title="Example: two browsers, shared engine,
    separate implementations (expected)">Valiant and Vertex (who, again,
    share an engine) both express implementer interest in a feature that
    does not yet have any implementations. If both implementers indicate
    that they do not expect to share an implementation (they do not
    expect to land their implementations in Shrug), the feature counts
    as having two implementers supporting it. If both implementers
    expect they’d share an implementation in Shrug, it counts as having
    one implementer supporting it.
